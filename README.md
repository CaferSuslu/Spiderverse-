# Spiderverse-
Java Spiderverse simulator that parses input files to construct a multiverse dimension graph (via a custom clustering hash table), manages Spider-people/anomaly records, and runs Dijkstra-based shortest-path routing to send anomalies from a hub to their home dimensions, producing SUCCESS/FAILED outcome reports.
